# US-flight-data-visualization-R-

# Assignment 
The data refer to all flights in the USA from 1987 to 2008.
For the project you will have to work with the data from 2004 to
2007 only.
The data and their description can be found here:

http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html

The project is the following:

Congratulations. The committee plans to hire you as the director of
New Orleans Airport (MSY,"New Orleans International "). We are in 2008, so they need to show that the
current director is not a good one and the airport at 2006-2007 period performed worst than the past (i.e. 2004-2005),
so they need to fire him. Help them to take the position.

Prepare 5 slides  that the committee can use to  support firing the current director from the position. Actually you need to show that during this  period  the airport performed worst.

GUIDELINES

1. 5 slides + opening slide

2. Attach the R code as well

3. To be more convincing you need to compare for example with other airports etc.

4. The committee  has sufficient knowledge to understand more sophisticated plots, do not use only barplots

5. All plots must be created using R in this project, exclusively

6. Every day of delay has  a penalty -2 points

7. Common plots between the  different submissions will be downgraded, try to be innovative and creative
